	Graph consists of either:
	
		SmerMap (indexing, optimized for adding nodes)
		SmerArray (routing)
		
	SmerMap
		16384 slices (2^14) - balanced using prefix-mixing
		
		Node split into 7bp prefix and lower 16bp
	
		Hash calculated based on the lower 16bp
			Lower part of hash determined location in slice
			Upper part of hash mixed with 7bp prefix determines slice
			
			 
	SmerArray
		16384 slices (2^14) - 1:1 with SmerMap slices
		
		Each slice contains queue of inbound requests from other slices
